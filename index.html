                <p>Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for over 165 million years during the Mesozoic Era, leaving behind
                    incredible
                    fossils that help us understand their world.
                    These fossils—ranging from massive skeletons to tiny footprints and even preserved skin
                    impressions—allow paleontologists to reconstruct not only the size and appearance of dinosaurs, but
                    also
                    how they lived, hunted, raised their young, and interacted with their environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mesozoic Era is divided into three major periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Each
                    period saw dramatic changes in climate, vegetation, and species diversity. Early dinosaurs in the
                    Triassic were relatively small and shared the planet with other reptile groups. By the Jurassic,
                    giants
                    like Brachiosaurus and Stegosaurus dominated lush forests, while fearsome predators such as
                    Allosaurus
                    stalked the landscape. The Cretaceous period introduced some of the most famous dinosaurs, including
                    Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, and fast, intelligent raptors.</p>

                <p>Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, around 230
                    million years ago. They dominated the planet during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods before most
                    species went extinct about 66 million years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These magnificent creatures ranged from the massive long-necked sauropods like Brachiosaurus to the
                    fearsome predators like Tyrannosaurus rex, and even small, feathered dinosaurs that would eventually
                    evolve into modern birds.</p>

                <p>Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient organisms. They form when plants, animals, or
                    other organisms are buried in sediment and, over millions of years, the organic material is replaced by
                    minerals.</p>
                <h3>How Fossils Form</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>An organism dies and is quickly buried by sediment</li>
                    <li>Soft tissues decay, leaving bones or shells</li>
                    <li>Minerals from groundwater seep into the remains</li>
                    <li>Over millions of years, the remains turn to stone</li>
                    <li>Erosion or excavation exposes the fossil</li>
